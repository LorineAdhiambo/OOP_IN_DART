Defined an interface Drivable with methods start() and stop().
Created a base class Car that implements the Drivable interface and overrides the methods start() and stop().
Defined a derived class ElectricCar that inherits from Car and overrides the start() method.
Implemented a method readCarsFromFile() that reads data from a file (cars.txt) and initializes instances of Car using that data.
Demonstrated the use of a loop in the main() function to iterate over the list of cars and call start() and stop() methods.
Finally, I created an instance of ElectricCar and call its start() method.
